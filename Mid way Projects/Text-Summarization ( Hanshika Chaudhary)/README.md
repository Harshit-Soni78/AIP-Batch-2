# Text-Summarization
"Automatic text summarization is the task of producing a concise and fluent summary while preserving key information content and overall meaning"
 - Saves Time
 - Enhances Productivity-Useful for those who need to review multiple documents efficiently
- Better Information Retrieval
-  Quick Decision-Making

In general, two different approaches are used for text summarization:
 
 -  **Extractive Summarization** : Only the most important sentences or phrases are extracted from the original text.
  It extracts sentences that contain the most frequently occurring important(meaningful) words 
 - **Abstractive Summarization** :  Exact sentence is used to generate new sentences summary by identifying the most important information of the original group of sentences. It is possible that these new sentences summary do not appear in the original sentences.

#  Future Enhancements
 - Fine-tune pre-trained models on domain-specific data (legal,medical,Scientific & Technical Research....)
 - Multilingual Support
 - Integration with Web and APIs
